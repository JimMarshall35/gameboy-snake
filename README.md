# gameboy-snake
this will be snake for gameboy, it's still a work in progress.

Snake moves around as it should but doesn't yet eat food and get longer, crash into itself.

The snake is drawn as part of the background tile layer to allow for a massive snake, and the timer overflow interrupt is used to advance the snake in whatever direction its facing. I've drawn different sprites for different parts of the snake but at the moment all segments of the snake are just drawn as the head.

Made from the "Hello world" example here as a starting point: https://eldred.fr/gb-asm-tutorial/part1/hello_world.html

I am actively working on it!
